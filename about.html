      <a href="../">I</a>'m working on <a href="preview/" target="_blank">a story.</a>  It's about 20% done, so some storylines end abruptly.  The back button doesn't work.  You can email me feedback&mdash;my Gmail address begins with haggardii.  Or you can comment on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8473231" target="_blank">HackerNews</a>
